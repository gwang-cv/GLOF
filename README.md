### Dataset
We collected several datasets as follows:
- VGG Oxford
- WideBaseline-Tuytelaars
- EVD The Extreme View Dataset. EVD is a set of 15 image pairs with ground truth homographies
- ECCV12 Photo-Collection and Additional Datasets, Comparative Evaluation of Binary Features
- BMVC12-Fixing the locally optimized ransac
- CVPR14-Shape-Preserving Half-Projective Warps for Image Stitching
- DAISY
The generated matlab (.mat) files can be downloaded from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YOdvTc93mYRGKO7y2N3Y3cVa26Cf6hMV/view?usp=sharing).
